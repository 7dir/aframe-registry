Curated collection of third-party A-Frame components.

Distributed as a JSON file for programmatic consumpton.

## Guidelines

- Keep the components in alphabetical order.
- The `url` field should be a direct link to the hosted JS file.
- The JS file should register the component (with `AFRAME.registerComponent`) with the same name as listed in the package.json.
